# NASA-Vue

[Deployed Link on Heroku](https://nasa-image-otd.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

NASA Vue was a take home coding challenge where I was given a spec and expected to complete the spec requirements on my own within 4 days. 

## Spec

Vue.js + the NASA APoD API
Build a single-page application in **Vue.js** that queries the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API and displays the day's image. The application should include a way to view each of the current month's pictures (it's okay if the month only has 1 photo so far, for example if it's the first of the month), and a way to return to the current day's picture. Be creative with how you present the collections - think about the experience of the viewer with what they want to view and learn.

## Goals

To learn a new language (Vue) in a short amount of time to complete a code challenge

## Technology Used

- Vue
